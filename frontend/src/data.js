              question: "What's your development approach?",
              answer: "I believe in clean, maintainable code, full stop. I start by looking at the problem from all angles, and designing a modular architecture that can evolve and be pruned at will. I create prototypes, gather feedback, and iterate. I prioritize communication and documentation throughout the process."

            {
              question: "How do you handle project timelines?",
              answer: "I break projects into manageable milestones with regular check-ins. I'm very transparent about progress or status and any potential delays, and I always build in buffer time for testing and refinement. I typically work in sessions of about 12 hours, but adjust based on project needs."

              answer: "My favorite is always the most efficient for the task at hand, I say it a lot, but efficiency is the name of the game. I do not mind refactoring to a different language in the name of efficiency. I love tools and languages that help me write clean, maintainable code with minimal overhead. I am partial to Go, JavaScript/Typescript and React, but I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks. I also love working with databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL."

            {
              question: "How do you ensure code quality?",
              answer: "I use linting, testing frameworks, code reviews, and follow established style guides. I believe in writing self-documenting code and comprehensive documentation. I make sure tests are written for critical paths and edge cases, and I use CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment."
