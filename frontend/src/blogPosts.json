    "body": "So I finally decided to build my portfolio! \n\nI went with React because it's what I've had the most experience with. The hardest part was deciding on a design that really made me feel proud to call it my own.\n\nThe backend is pretty straightforward Node.js with MongoDB. Nothing fancy, just stores/fetches stats. For the frontend I started with a Terminal based interface, but I wanted to make it more accessible to all users, my family, friends etc.\n\nSo I thought about what made me excited about a user interface, and for me it is the smoothness and the interactivity. So I focused on the menu to start, adding in sort of a playstation / gamecube style project wheel and keyboard enabled navigation.\n\nNow I just need to actually write some blog posts to fill this thing up. \n\nOverall, I'm really happy with how it turned out. It's a work in progress, but I feel like it represents me well and shows off my skills while still keeping to my minimalist aesthetic. \n\nIf you're looking to build your own portfolio, my advice is to just start. Don't overthink it! You will start to find your style / what you like as you go. Progress over perfection is the key. And remember, it's okay to iterate and improve over time. Your portfolio is a reflection of you and should evolve with you.",
